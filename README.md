# Simple CV Generator

This is a straightforward React project designed for my own learning purposes and as such should not be considered production code. It focuses on understanding React components and state management. The application generates a basic Curriculum Vitae (CV) with a simple yet mostly responsive layout.

### Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cv-generator.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd cv-generator
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Usage

Run the application locally:

```bash
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:5173 to see the app. Note that this project is not intended for production use; it serves as a practical exercise for learning React fundamentals.

Feel free to customize the CV content and experiment with the code.
